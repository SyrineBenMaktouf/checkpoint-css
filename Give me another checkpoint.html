    <h2>A mantis shrimp can swing its claw so fast it boils the water around it and creates a flash of light.</h2>
<div class="text1">
        Mantis shrimp are crustaceans, a group of animals that includes crabs
        and lobsters. Although mantis> 
        shrimp resemble lobsters, they >are more shrimp-sized.
     Most are 6 to 12 centimeters (2 to 5 inches) long.
      If anything, mantis shrimp resemble cartoon characters.
       Antennae that detect >chemicals extend from their heads and stiff, 
       paddlelike flaps on the sides of their head probably act as ears.
        Spines often decorate their tails. Big eyes on stalks bug out from their heads.
         And the animals come in dazzling colors, including green, pink, orange and electric blue.

         <div class="text4">
                When a person dies, their muscles goes through many changes to include  rigor mortis. The hair follicles do much the same thing. As the hair  follicles contract, it causes the appearance of goosebumps.
                And there have been many instances where a body is exhumed and the hair has grown.

         <div class="text5">
                Of course, that's not something you can reasonably do in the real world. 
                The structure of matter requires that empty space. Without it, 
                particles collapse into much stranger and incomprehensible forms.
                 But in theory, yes, the only thing making humanity bigger than a three-inch cube is empty space.

         <div class="text6">
            <br><br>The only reason why air would pass through one nostril more than the other,
                is extra bone growth and other obstructions in one nostril. 
                This, however, varies from person to person,
                 is not the same for everyone, 
               and it is not necessary it has to happen.
